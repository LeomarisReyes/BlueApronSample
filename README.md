When I was looking for a Mockup design theme to choose to translate to XAML, I made sure that it met the following conditions:

* Different layouts implementations
* Different UI controls to apply
* Clear relationship between the screens to make the navigation more intuitive.
* Colorful and friendly design

So, thatâ€™s why I chose the Blue Apron design, because it met the requirements that I believe are necessary to have a great UI Design.
To do it, I used [pttrns](https://pttrns.com/applications/607) website.

I wrote a post about this project:  https://medium.com/@reyes.leomaris/translating-a-mockup-design-theme-to-xaml-55d8e6003b4d
